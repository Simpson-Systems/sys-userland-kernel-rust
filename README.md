here's some userland ideas for rust: Examples that are perfect next steps after memmap:

ELF header parser (amazing Rust learning)

Page table entry struct (bitfields + flags)

Simple bump allocator

Simple slab allocator

Packet parser (fake Ethernet/IP header)

Virtual file table (inode style



The strategy is to follow the brown rust book at: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html
do some exercises in it, and do turing complete

and also do stringent testing to get better at rust
